# GroupMe-Bots
This repository contains the code for the GroupMe bots I am developing as Technology chair. The CreateBot.py script is used to create a new GroupMe bot programmatically, and the ListGroupIDs.py script lists the Group ID for each GroupMe group that I am a member of. Values like Bot ID, Access Token, and Group ID are stored in a .env file for security.
