# RushBot

This directory contains the code for the RushBot, a GroupMe bot I developed to share information with individuals rushing Theta Tau - Zeta Delta. Within this directory, there is also a YAML file, which I used to schedule the execution of the Python script, RushBot.py, every day at 9am. This scheduling and execution was done using a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps.
